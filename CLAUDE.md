### ðŸŽ¯ current functionality

**score input system**:
- Tap any cell in the scorecard to select it
- Use the keypad to input scores (X, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, M)
- Auto-advance moves to the next cell after score input
- CLEAR button removes score from selected cell

**calculation engine**:
- Real-time end totals with X=10, M=0 scoring
- Sum of 6 appears on even-numbered ends (2, 4, 6, etc.)
- Accumulative column shows running total through each end
- X/10/9 counters track precision shots
- Final score displayed prominently

**configuration options**:
- Toggle between 3 or 6 arrows per end
- Choose 10 or 12 ends per set
- Settings automatically reinitialize scorecard

Color scheme follows archery conventions:
- Gold/amber for X and 10 values (highest scores)
- Blue highlighting for end totals
- Yellow background for Sum of 6 calculations
- Green shading for accumulative totals

## next development priorities

### ðŸ”§ core architecture improvements

1. **data models creation**:
   - `core/models/arrow.dart`: Individual arrow score with value and metadata
   - `core/models/end.dart`: Collection of arrows with calculations
   - `core/models/set.dart`: Collection of ends with set-level statistics
   - `core/models/match.dart`: Complete scoring session with settings

2. **score calculator refactoring**:
   - Move calculation logic from widgets to `core/calculators/score_calculator.dart`
   - Implement proper business logic separation
   - Add validation for score inputs

3. **state management implementation**:
   - Choose Provider or Riverpod for application state
   - Create proper state management for scoring sessions
   - Implement reactive UI updates

### code organization principles

**separation of concerns**:
- Presentation layer handles only UI logic
- Business logic isolated in core modules
- Data access abstracted through repositories
- Configuration centralized in config modules

**testability**:
- Widget tests for UI components
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for complete workflows
- Mock implementations for external dependencies

**maintainability**:
- Clear naming conventions throughout
- Consistent file and directory organization
- Documentation for complex business rules
- Error handling at appropriate layers

## design decisions and rationale

### scorecard layout

The scoring grid exactly matches traditional paper scorecards to ensure familiar user experience:
- End numbers in left column for easy reference
- Arrow score columns (#1, #2, #3 or #1-#6)
- Calculated columns (Sum of 3, Sum of 6, Accumulative) match paper format
- X/10/9 counting section at bottom for quick reference

### keypad design

Button layout follows the user's exact specifications:
- 4x3 grid with logical score arrangement
- Color coding matches archery scoring conventions
- CLEAR button prominently placed for error correction
- Touch-friendly sizing for mobile devices

### auto-advance behavior

Score input automatically moves to the next logical cell:
- Within an end: moves from arrow #1 to #2 to #3
- Between ends: moves to arrow #1 of next end
- Reduces tap count and speeds up scoring process
- Can be overridden by tapping specific cells

### calculation accuracy

All score calculations follow official archery rules:
- X scores as 10 points in totals
- M (miss) scores as 0 points
- Sum of 6 only displays on even-numbered ends
- Accumulative totals include all previous ends
- Final score matches bottom accumulative cell

   - Business logic goes in `core/`
   - UI components in `presentation/widgets/`
   - Data handling in `data/`

2. **maintain the design consistency**:
   - Reference `.uidesign/` files for visual specifications
   - Follow established color schemes and layouts
   - Test on multiple screen sizes

3. **update tests**:
   - Add unit tests for business logic
   - Create widget tests for new UI components
   - Include integration tests for complete workflows

## conclusion

The archery bookkeeper application has a solid foundation with a working scoring interface that matches traditional paper scorecards. The modular architecture provides a clear path for adding advanced features while maintaining code quality and testability.

The next development phase should focus on data persistence and proper state management to enable session saving and loading. This will transform the application from a calculator into a complete scoring solution for archery practitioners.

The user-provided design references ensure the application maintains authenticity to archery scoring conventions while leveraging modern digital capabilities for enhanced usability and functionality.
