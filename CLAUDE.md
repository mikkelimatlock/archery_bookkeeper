### ðŸŽ¯ current functionality

**sophisticated end interaction system**:
- Smart cell selection with automatic snapping: empty cell taps redirect to first empty in that end
- Active end visual highlighting with blue glow and background tint for entire end group
- Keypad pop-up behavior: appears when cell is armed, retracts on completion or manual dismiss
- Per-end descending score sorting (Xâ†’10â†’9â†’...â†’1â†’M) maintaining visual stability during input
- Cross-end disarm prevents auto-advance between ends, requiring deliberate end transitions
- Enhanced 4x4 keypad layout with CLEAR (red) and CLOSE (blue) functional buttons
- Background tap dismissal and manual CLOSE button for flexible keypad management

**calculation engine**:

### centralized color architecture

The application features a sophisticated color management system with the `ScoringColorScheme` class providing consistent visual theming across all components.

**key architectural features**:
- Complete color system in `lib/config/constants/scoring_colors.dart`
- Traditional (vibrant) and lowSaturation (muted) color schemes available
- Explicit text/background color pairs preventing contrast issues
- Comprehensive disabled state support for conditional UI elements
- Performance-optimized compile-time constants with zero runtime overhead

**intelligent adaptive behavior**:
- Sum of 6 column automatically greys out in 3-arrow mode while maintaining layout
- Disabled states preserve visual hierarchy while clearly indicating inactive status
- Color scheme switching requires single constant change for global application
- Extensible architecture ready for additional themes (high contrast, dark mode, etc.)

See `lib/config/constants/_constants.md` for complete usage documentation and implementation examples.

### code organization principles

**separation of concerns**:
- Presentation layer handles only UI logic
- Business logic isolated in core modules
- Data access abstracted through repositories
- Configuration centralized in config modules

**testability**:
- Widget tests for UI components
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for complete workflows
- Mock implementations for external dependencies

**maintainability**:
- Clear naming conventions throughout
- Consistent file and directory organization
- Documentation for complex business rules
- Error handling at appropriate layers

## design decisions and rationale

### scorecard layout

The scoring grid exactly matches traditional paper scorecards to ensure familiar user experience:
- End numbers in left column for easy reference
- Arrow score columns (#1, #2, #3 or #1-#6)
- Calculated columns (Sum of 3, Sum of 6, Accumulative) match paper format
- X/10/9 counting section at bottom for quick reference

### enhanced keypad design

Advanced 4x4 layout with responsive architecture:
- 4x3 score grid (75% width) with logical arrangement (X,10,9/8,7,6/5,4,3/2,1,M)
- functional column (25% width) with CLEAR (red) and CLOSE (blue) buttons
- percentage-based responsive sizing using Expanded flex widgets
- color coding matches archery scoring conventions
- touch-friendly sizing optimized for mobile devices
- split viewport positioning prevents UI obstruction

### sophisticated end interaction flow

Advanced scoring workflow with intelligent behaviors:
- smart cell selection: empty cell taps automatically snap to first empty in that end
- active end highlighting: entire end group receives blue glow and background tint
- auto-advance within ends: moves through arrow #1 to #2 to #3 after score input
- cross-end disarm: prevents automatic advance between ends, requiring deliberate transitions
- per-end descending sort: scores organize (Xâ†’10â†’9â†’...â†’1â†’M) with visual stability
- keypad pop-up/retract: appears on cell arm, retracts on completion or manual dismiss
- multiple dismissal methods: CLOSE button, background tap, or automatic on completion

### calculation accuracy

All score calculations follow official archery rules:
- X scores as 10 points in totals
- M (miss) scores as 0 points
- Sum of 6 only displays on even-numbered ends
- Accumulative totals include all previous ends
- Final score matches bottom accumulative cell
