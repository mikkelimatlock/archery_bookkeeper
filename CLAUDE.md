### ðŸŽ¯ current functionality

**score input system**:
- Tap any cell in the scorecard to select it
- Use the keypad to input scores (X, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, M)
- Auto-advance moves to the next cell after score input
- CLEAR button removes score from selected cell

**calculation engine**:
- Real-time end totals with X=10, M=0 scoring and proper bounds checking
- Mode-specific behavior: 3-arrow (10 ends) vs 6-arrow (6 ends) automatically inferred
- Sum of 3: active per row in 3-arrow mode, completely greyed in 6-arrow mode
- Sum of 6: displays on odd visual rows in both modes with correct 6-arrow grouping
- Accumulative column shows running total through each logical end
- X/10/9 counters track precision shots
- Final score displayed prominently

**configuration options**:
- Toggle between 3 or 6 arrows per end
- End count automatically inferred: 3-arrow mode = 10 ends (Indoor), 6-arrow mode = 6 ends (Outdoor)

### centralized color architecture

The application features a sophisticated color management system with the `ScoringColorScheme` class providing consistent visual theming across all components.

**key architectural features**:
- Complete color system in `lib/config/constants/scoring_colors.dart`
- Traditional (vibrant) and lowSaturation (muted) color schemes available
- Explicit text/background color pairs preventing contrast issues
- Comprehensive disabled state support for conditional UI elements
- Performance-optimized compile-time constants with zero runtime overhead

**intelligent adaptive behavior**:
- Sum of 6 column automatically greys out in 3-arrow mode while maintaining layout
- Disabled states preserve visual hierarchy while clearly indicating inactive status
- Color scheme switching requires single constant change for global application
- Extensible architecture ready for additional themes (high contrast, dark mode, etc.)

See `lib/config/constants/_constants.md` for complete usage documentation and implementation examples.

### code organization principles

**separation of concerns**:
- Presentation layer handles only UI logic
- Business logic isolated in core modules
- Data access abstracted through repositories
- Configuration centralized in config modules

**testability**:
- Widget tests for UI components
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for complete workflows
- Mock implementations for external dependencies

**maintainability**:
- Clear naming conventions throughout
- Consistent file and directory organization
- Documentation for complex business rules
- Error handling at appropriate layers

## design decisions and rationale

### scorecard layout

The scoring grid exactly matches traditional paper scorecards to ensure familiar user experience:
- End numbers in left column for easy reference
- Arrow score columns (#1, #2, #3 or #1-#6)
- Calculated columns (Sum of 3, Sum of 6, Accumulative) match paper format
- X/10/9 counting section at bottom for quick reference

### keypad design

Button layout follows the user's exact specifications:
- 4x3 grid with logical score arrangement
- Color coding matches archery scoring conventions
- CLEAR button prominently placed for error correction
- Touch-friendly sizing for mobile devices

### auto-advance behavior

Score input automatically moves to the next logical cell:
- Within an end: moves from arrow #1 to #2 to #3
- Between ends: moves to arrow #1 of next end
- Reduces tap count and speeds up scoring process
- Can be overridden by tapping specific cells

### calculation accuracy

All score calculations follow official archery rules:
- X scores as 10 points in totals
- M (miss) scores as 0 points
- Sum of 6 only displays on even-numbered ends
- Accumulative totals include all previous ends
- Final score matches bottom accumulative cell
